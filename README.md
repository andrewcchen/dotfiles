My config files

Here are a few thing that are maybe of some interest to you:

- A keymap to have SpaceFN function on my laptop keyboard. See `xkb/` and `udev/hwdb.d/`
- xmonad and xmobar configurations

All files created by me are available under BSD-3 license. Or really just do whatever you want with them, it's not like I'm gonna sue you.
